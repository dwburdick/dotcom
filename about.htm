					<span class="hello">Hello!</span> I'm a human male living in Denver and otherwise spending a lot of time in New York City. I spend a lot of time learning, which is probably my chief hobby. Others include reading, writing, casual hiking, board games and watching soccer. During traditional business hours, you can find me at the Denver Post, where I am described as the deputy features editor and entertainment editor.
