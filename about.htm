					<p><span class="hello">Hello!</span> I'm a human male living in Denver. I spend a lot of time learning, which is probably my chief hobby. Others include reading, writing, casual hiking, board games and watching soccer. </p>

					<h3>Work</h3>
					<div class="about-text">
						<p>I've worked for traditional news organizations, startups, a Buddhist-inspired university, I was a stand-up comedian, I interned at a radio station and I had a high-school job in a big-box retail store.</p>
						<p>I've worked for women and men, and I've managed women and men ranging from about 8 years younger than me to about 30 years older than me.</p>
						<p>I like solving problems collaboratively and helping colleagues achieve personal goals. And cracking wise.</p>
